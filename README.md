# heapq-ruby

The Ruby standard library is missing a proper built-in implementation of the `heapq` or Priority Queue algorithm.

This repository is for my personal implementation for this algorithm for use in my own projects.

## Installing

Just download the `heapq.rb` file and `require` it wherever you would like to use it.

## License

GPLv3. See the `LICENSE` file.
