# heapq-ruby

The Ruby standard library is missing a proper built-in implementation of the `heapq` or Priority Queue algorithm.

This repository is for my personal implementation for this algorithm for use in my own projects.

## Installing

Just download the `heapq.rb` file and `require` it wherever you would like to use it. No additional dependencies.

## Testing

```bash
gem install rspec
git clone https://github.com/cultureshocked/heapq-ruby
cd heapq-ruby
rspec

```

See `spec/heapq_spec.rb` for the unit tests.
